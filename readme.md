# fshlb, gifko & subsYeah

Windows utilities used to create twitter friendly videos. 

All utilities here use __ffmpeg__ for processing so you have to install that first, there is a very nice guide for this [here](http://adaptivesamples.com/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows/).

Optimal video sizes for twitter are 320x180, 640x360 and 1280x720. The quality of outputs will be best if pictures or video inputs are one of these.

Once ffmpeg is installed just download the files from here into a separate folder on your machine and you can launch fshlbPro, gifko or subsYeah (just double click on them).

__fshlbPro__ takes as input a picture (ideally a png file in one of the above sizes) and an audio file and combines them into an mp4 video suitable to upload to twitter with the picutre in the background and audio visualisation in the foreground.

It is somewhat configurable and you can save configurations for later use, the most common ones are already supplied (for the three common file sizes).
The usage is simple, when you run it, it should all be quite intuitive, but there are explanations in tooltips, just hover mouse over fields on the screen.

__gifkoPro__ takes as input an existing video (something you made or downloaded, mayeb from youtube or wherever) and creates a short snippet of it (you choose from and to values) in a format that works nicely with twitter.

__subsYeahPro__ takes as input a video and an .srt subtitles file and hardcodes the subtitles into the video so that it's only one file, suitable for uploading to social networks.

Note that twitter imposes limits on video sizes - they must be shorter than 2m20s and smaller than 512Mb (more details [here](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20172128#video-formats)).


Please let us know if you used them and most certainly if they did not work ( unusual.computers(at)gmail.com ).
